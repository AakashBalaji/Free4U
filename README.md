What is Free4U?

Free4U is an App that pinpoints nearby freebies and alerts users to their location.
Many young people find it difficult to make ends meet, at other times, well, who doesn’t like a freebie? Getting free stuff is something we all enjoy, but happens rarely. People have fixed budgets and fixed incomes, and sometimes don’t necessarily have the income necessary to enjoy the finer pleasures in life. This is where Free4u comes into play: an app which gives you the creature comforts we all want at no cost!
